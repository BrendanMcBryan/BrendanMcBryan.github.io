###### Coding Portfolio

# Version 2.0

##### 2019.07.20

It's Been 2 Months and boy have we learned a lot. This new Portfolio is contained in one page, easliy implemented Bootstrap, and provide a nice clean view of all of the projects from my PENN Coding Bootcamp (so far!).

### Further

Clearly its time to get this info in to a database, give my self a portal to adjust that database, and let the styling/html creation get automate.

## Version 1.0

##### 2019.05.18

this verison of the portfolio is the first live version.
Using CSS and HTML I have created this webpage.

Styling was difficult but I was able to understand the basic concepts and eventually get it to work the way I wanted it to work.

### for furthere study.

    Aliging elments vertically with a division is still confusing and will be further studied.
